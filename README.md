# MNISTClassifier

A learning algorithm that uses the MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html) dataset to train a k-Nearest Neighbor Classifer on 60,000 points of labeled data. Uses pygame to allow the user to draw a single new test case with a mouse pointer. Finally performs back testing using a test set to determine the test error.

Current test error: 3.16%
